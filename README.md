# assessment_archive: tools for working with the NWFSC assessment archive

Hopefully this will be a funtional R package someday. Initially the only working
element is the R/load_assessments.R script, which will load model output
for 28 west coast groundfish stocks with assessments conducted between 2015 
and 2019 plus the 2021 Pacific Hake assessment.

Currently requires access to the assessment archive at
\\nwcfile.nmfs.local\fram\Assessments\Archives\

See issue #1 for some proposed design ideas.
