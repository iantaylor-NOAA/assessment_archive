# assessment_archive: tools for working with the NWFSC assessment archive

Hopefully this will be a funtional R package someday. Initially the only working
element is the R/load_assessments.R script, which will load model output
for 40 west coast groundfish stocks with assessments conducted between 2015 
and 2024.

Currently requires access to the assessment archive at
\\nwcfile.nmfs.local\fram\Assessments\Archives\

See issue #1 for some proposed design ideas.
